# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
# Binary conversion using built-in function

num = int(input("Enter a decimal number: "))

binary = bin(num)

print("Binary equivalent:", binary)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the Python program to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent using a built-in function was executed successfully.
